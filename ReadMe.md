Clone the Repo, install node modules (npm install), & insure package.json is present (npm init). If nodemon isn't installed, please install that as well (npm install nodemon -g). Use the schema file to create a database in MYSQL and seed it with data from seed.sql.

Once the node modules & the database are created you can move on to usage.

## Usage
